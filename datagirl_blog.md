# This is a work in progress

###Blog
I plan to use a blog to document my data science projects and learning that I'm working on.  It will be a mix of showing interesting results and notes on my learning (similar to Clare Corthell on http://datasciencemasters.org/).

###Direction
1. linear algebra (Khan Academy)
2. github tutorial
3. different evaluation metrics (https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Metrics)
