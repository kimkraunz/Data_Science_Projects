# This is a work in progress

###Blog
I plan to use a blog to document my data science projects and learning that I'm working on.  It will be a mix of showing interesting results and notes on my learning (similar to Clare Corthell on http://datasciencemasters.org/).  I plan to identify online resources and share them as well as explore data and make my own predictions.

###Direction
1. linear algebra (Khan Academy)
2. github tutorial (https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real)
3. Evaluation metrics (https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Metrics)
4. Bayesian predictions using fantasy football weekly projections
5. Amazon Web Services (Cloud Academy)
6. Hadoop (https://www.coursera.org/learn/hadoop)

I love that Kaggle is now posting datasets for exploration.  As I move through this process I will be using one or two of their available datasets.
