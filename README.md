# Data_Science_Projects
This repository hosts the data science projects that I have completed or am currently working on.

#kaggle_tree_coverage
The kaggle_tree_coverage file hosts the scripts used for my entries into the Kaggle Forest Coverage Type Prediction contest.  It was my first contest and with my fifth submission I made it to 102 on the leaderboard (out of 1450 at the time).  I've since dropped to 133 and will most likely drop further as the contest is still ongoing.  I hope to return to it to better my model but I'm not sure whether I will be able to before the contest closes.

#Kickstarter
The Kickstarter file contains the script and presentation I developed for my Capstone Project for the Data Science course that I took at General Assembly.  I predicted whether a Kickstarter project would be funded or not and how much would be pledged in the future.  It also contains some interesting graphs on the data that I had.  Check it out!  It was a great project to work on.
