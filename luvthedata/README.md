# This is a work in progress

#Blog
I plan to use a blog to document my data science projects and learning that I'm working on.  It will be a mix of showing interesting results and notes on my learning (similar to Clare Corthell on http://datasciencemasters.org/).  I plan to identify online resources and share them as well as explore data and make my own predictions.  I am in the midst of setting up the blog.

#Direction
One of the reasons that I am attracted to the field of data science is that there are some many opportunities to learn and grow.  I like the balance of using both online tutorials and experimenting with data.  I plan to use the blog to explore areas where I feel like I can use some support.  I've identified the following:

##Theory
  Linear algebra- I've already started the Khan Academy

##Refining data science tools
* I am committed to consistent use of Git and Github both as a version control for myself and an opportunity to share my work.
* SQL - I will continue to practice using SQL (and python) with [this Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases)
* Regex - I will continue to practice regex
* Hadoop
  * Amazon Web Services (Cloud Academy)
  * Hadoop (https://www.coursera.org/learn/hadoop)
* Data science methods
  * Evaluation metrics (https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Metrics)
  * Bayesian predictions using fantasy football weekly projections

I love that Kaggle is now posting datasets for exploration.  As I move through this process I will be using one or two of their available datasets.
